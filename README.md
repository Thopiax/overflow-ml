# OverflowML

This package is used to analyze and predict the impact of climate change on the frequency and duration of combined sewage overflow (CSO) events.

## Problem Statement

The combined sewer system (CSS) collects both rain water and wastewater in an unified canalization system. These systems can be overwhelmed by high-intensity rainfalls, when the storage capacity is exceeded by incoming storm water. Consequently, this produces a combined sewer overflow (CSO) which results in untreated storm and wastewater being discharged directly into receiving bodies of water (e.g. rivers, lakes, etc.). Clearly, this is a massive issue to public health and biodiversity.
In the context of global climate change, where high-intensity precipitation is expected to grow in frequency and intensity, these events may become more and more frequent and severe.
